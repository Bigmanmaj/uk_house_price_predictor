# UK House Price Predictor â€“ Project Plan

## Objective
Develop an interactive web app that predicts UK house prices based on region, property type, and basic user inputs. The app visualizes predictions on a map and provides regional insights. The backend will use machine learning techniques to estimate house prices based on metric mentioned above

## Timeline
